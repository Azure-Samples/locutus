{"prompt": "", "completion": " Look at Aegisthus; he must needs make love to Agamemnons wife unrighteously and then kill Agamemnon, though he knew it would be the death of him; for I sent Mercury to warn him not to do either of these things, inasmuch as Orestes would be sure to take his revenge when he grew up and wanted to return home.\n\n\n###\n\n"}

Why then should you keep on being so angry with him? And Jove said, My child, what are you talking about? How can I forget Ulysses than whom there is no more capable man on earth, nor more liberal in his offerings to the immortal gods that live in heaven? Bear in mind, however, that Neptune is still furious with Ulysses for having blinded an eye of Polyphemus king of the Cyclopes.\n\n\n###\n\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " I could have borne it better even though he were dead, if he had fallen with his men before Troy, or had died with friends around him when the days of his fighting were done; for then the Achaeans would have built a mound over his ashes, and I should myself have been heir to his renown; but now the storm-winds have spirited him away we know not whither; he is gone without leaving so much as a trace behind him, and I inherit nothing but dismay.\n\n\n###\n\n"}

Who knows but what Ulysses may come back after all, and pay these scoundrels in full, either single-handed or with a force of Achaeans behind him? If Minerva were to take as great a liking to you as she did to Ulysses when we were fighting before Troy (for I never yet saw the gods so openly fond of any one as Minerva then was of your father), if she would take as good care of you as she did of him, these wooers would soon some of them forget their wooing.\n\n\n###\n\n"}

I will tell you truly, answered Nestor, and indeed you have yourself divined how it all happened.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If Menelaus when he got back from Troy had found Aegisthus still alive in his house, there would have been no barrow heaped up for him, not even when he was dead, but he would have been thrown outside the city to dogs and vultures, and not a woman would have mourned him, for he had done a deed of great wickedness; but we were over there, fighting hard at Troy, and Aegisthus, who was taking his ease quietly in the heart of Argos, cajoled Agamemnons wife Clytemnestra with incessant flattery.\n\n\n###\n\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " He killed many Trojans and got much information before he reached the Argive camp, for all which things the Trojan women made lamentation, but for my own part I was glad, for my heart was beginning to yearn after my home, and I was unhappy about the wrong that Venus had done me in taking me over there, away from my country, my girl, and my lawful wedded husband, who is indeed by no means deficient either in person or understanding.\n\n\n###\n\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " I am afraid of the gossip and scandal that may be set on foot against me later on; for the people here are very ill-natured, and some low fellow, if he met us, might say, Who is this fine-looking stranger that is going about with Nausicaa? Where did she find him? I suppose she is going to marry him.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Perhaps he is a vagabond sailor whom she has taken from some foreign vessel, for we have no neighbours; or some god has at last come down from heaven in answer to her prayers, and she is going to live with him all the rest of her life.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " It would be a good thing if she would take herself off and find a husband somewhere else, for she will not look at one of the many excellent young Phaeacians who are in love with her.\n\n\n###\n\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " She was careful not to go too fast for Ulysses and the maids who were following on foot along with the waggon, so she plied her whip with judgement.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " As the sun was going down they came to the sacred grove of Minerva, and there Ulysses sat down and prayed to the mighty daughter of Jove.\n\n\n###\n\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Thus did he pray, and Minerva heard his prayer, but she would not show herself to him openly, for she was afraid of her uncle Neptune, who was still furious in his endeavors to prevent Ulysses from getting home.\n\n\n###\n\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " I will go before you and show the way, but say not a word as you go, and do not look at any man, nor ask him questions; for the people here cannot abide strangers, and do not like men who come from some other place.\n\n\n###\n\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " On this she led the way, and Ulysses followed in her steps; but not one of the Phaeacians could see him as he passed through the city in the midst of them; for the great goddess Minerva in her good will towards him had hidden him in a thick cloud of darkness.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " He admired their harbours, ships, places of assembly, and the lofty walls of the city, which, with the palisade on top of them, were very striking, and when they reached the kings house Minerva said: This is the house, father stranger, which you would have me show you.\n\n\n###\n\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Thus she both was, and still is, respected beyond measure by her children, by Alcinous himself, and by the whole people, who look upon her as a goddess, and greet her whenever she goes about the city, for she is a thoroughly good woman both in head and heart, and when any women are friends of hers, she will help their husbands also to settle their disputes.\n\n\n###\n\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Arete was the first to speak, for she recognised the shirt, cloak, and good clothes that Ulysses was wearing, as the work of herself and of her maids; so she said, Stranger, before we go any further, there is a question I should like to ask you.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Who, and whence are you, and who gave you those clothes? Did you not say you had come here from beyond the sea? And Ulysses answered, It would be a long story Madam, were I to relate in full the tale of my misfortunes, for the hand of heaven has been laid heavy upon me; but as regards your question, there is an island far away in the sea which is called the Ogygian.\n\n\n###\n\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " My brave comrades were drowned every man of them, but I stuck to the keel and was carried hither and thither for the space of nine days, till at last during the darkness of the tenth night the gods brought me to the Ogygian island where the great goddess Calypso lives.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " She took me in and treated me with the utmost kindness; indeed she wanted to make me immortal that I might never grow old, but she could not persuade me to let her do so.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I stayed with Calypso seven years straight on end, and watered the good clothes she gave me with my tears during the whole time; but at last when the eighth year came round she bade me depart of her own free will, either because Jove had told her she must, or because she had changed her mind.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " She sent me from her island on a raft, which she provisioned with abundance of bread and wine.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Moreover she gave me good stout clothing, and sent me a wind that blew both warm and fair.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Days seven and ten did I sail over the sea, and on the eighteenth I caught sight of the first outlines of the mountains upon your coastand glad indeed was I to set eyes upon them.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Nevertheless there was still much trouble in store for me, for at this point Neptune would let me go no further, and raised a great storm against me; the sea was so terribly high that I could no longer keep to my raft, which went to pieces under the fury of the gale, and I had to swim for it, till wind and current brought me to your shores.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There I tried to land, but could not, for it was a bad place and the waves dashed me against the rocks, so I again took to the sea and swam on till I came to a river that seemed the most likely landing place, for there were no rocks and it was sheltered from the wind.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Here, then, I got out of the water and gathered my senses together again.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Night was coming on, so I left the river, and went into a thicket, where I covered myself all over with leaves, and presently heaven sent me off into a very deep sleep.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Sick and sorry as I was I slept among the leaves all night, and through the next day till afternoon, when I woke as the sun was westering, and saw your daughters maid servants playing upon the beach, and your daughter among them looking like a goddess.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I besought her aid, and she proved to be of an excellent disposition, much more so than could be expected from so young a personfor young people are apt to be thoughtless.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " She gave me plenty of bread and wine, and when she had had me washed in the river she also gave me the clothes in which you see me.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, therefore, though it has pained me to do so, I have told you the whole truth.\n\n\n###\n\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Stranger, replied Alcinous, I am not the kind of man to get angry about nothing; it is always better to be reasonable; but by Father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, now that I see what kind of person you are, and how much you think as I do, I wish you would stay here, marry my daughter, and become my son-in-law.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If you will stay I will give you a house and an estate, but no one (heaven forbid) shall keep you here against your own wish, and that you may be sure of this I will attend tomorrow to the matter of your escort.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You can sleep64 during the whole voyage if you like, and the men shall sail you over smooth waters either to your own home, or wherever you please, even though it be a long way further off than Euboea, which those of my people who saw it when they took yellow-haired Rhadamanthus to see Tityus the son of Gaia, tell me is the furthest of any placeand yet they did the whole voyage in a single day without distressing themselves, and came back again afterwards.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You will thus see how much my ships excel all others, and what magnificent oarsmen my sailors are.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Then was Ulysses glad and prayed aloud saying, Father Jove, grant that Alcinous may do all as he has said, for so he will win an imperishable name among mankind, and at the same time I shall return to my country.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Thus did they converse.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Then Arete told her maids to set a bed in the room that was in the gatehouse, and make it with good red rugs, and to spread coverlets on the top of them with woollen cloaks for Ulysses to wear.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The maids thereon went out with torches in their hands, and when they had made the bed they came up to Ulysses and said, Rise, sir stranger, and come with us for your bed is ready, and glad indeed was he to go to his rest.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So Ulysses slept in a bed placed in a room over the echoing gateway; but Alcinous lay in the inner part of the house, with the queen his wife by his side.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Alcinous and Ulysses both rose, and Alcinous led the way to the Phaeacian place of assembly, which was near the ships.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When they got there they sat down side by side on a seat of polished stone, while Minerva took the form of one of Alcinous servants, and went round the town in order to help Ulysses to get home.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " She went up to the citizens, man by man, and said, Aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, come to the assembly all of you and listen to the stranger who has just come off a long voyage to the house of King Alcinous; he looks like an immortal god.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " With these words she made them all want to come, and they flocked to the assembly till seats and standing room were alike crowded.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Every one was struck with the appearance of Ulysses, for Minerva had beautified him about the head and shoulders, making him look taller and stouter than he really was, that he might impress the Phaeacians favourably as being a very remarkable man, and might come off well in the many trials of skill to which they would challenge him.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Then, when they were got together, Alcinous spoke: Hear me, said he, aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, that I may speak even as I am minded.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " This stranger, whoever he may be, has found his way to my house from somewhere or other either East or West.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " He wants an escort and wishes to have the matter settled.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let us then get one ready for him, as we have done for others before him; indeed, no one who ever yet came to my house has been able to complain of me for not speeding on his way soon enough.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let us draw a ship into the seaone that has never yet made a voyageand man her with two and fifty of our smartest young sailors.\n\n\n###\n\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " I am giving these instructions to the young men who will form the crew, for as regards you aldermen and town councillors, you will join me in entertaining our guest in the cloisters.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I can take no excuses, and we will have Demodocus to sing to us; for there is no bard like him whatever he may choose to sing about.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Alcinous then led the way, and the others followed after, while a servant went to fetch Demodocus.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The fifty-two picked oarsmen went to the sea shore as they had been told, and when they got there they drew the ship into the water, got her mast and sails inside her, bound the oars to the thole-pins with twisted thongs of leather, all in due course, and spread the white sails aloft.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " They moored the vessel a little way out from land, and then came on shore and went to the house of King Alcinous.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The out houses,66 yards, and all the precincts were filled with crowds of men in great multitudes both old and young; and Alcinous killed them a dozen sheep, eight full grown pigs, and two oxen.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " These they skinned and dressed so as to provide a magnificent banquet.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " A servant presently led in the famous bard Demodocus, whom the muse had dearly loved, but to whom she had given both good and evil, for though she had endowed him with a divine gift of song, she had robbed him of his eyesight.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Pontonous set a seat for him among the guests, leaning it up against a bearing-post.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " He hung the lyre for him on a peg over his head, and showed him where he was to feel for it with his hands.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " He also set a fair table with a basket of victuals by his side, and a cup of wine from which he might drink whenever he was so disposed.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The company then laid their hands upon the good things that were before them, but as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, the muse inspired Demodocus to sing the feats of heroes, and more especially a matter that was then in the mouths of all men, to wit, the quarrel between Ulysses and Achilles, and the fierce words that they heaped on one another as they sat together at a banquet.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But Agamemnon was glad when he heard his chieftains quarrelling with one another, for Apollo had foretold him this at Pytho when he crossed the stone floor to consult the oracle.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Here was the beginning of the evil that by the will of Jove fell both upon Danaans and Trojans.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Thus sang the bard, but Ulysses drew his purple mantle over his head and covered his face, for he was ashamed to let the Phaeacians see that he was weeping.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When the bard left off singing he wiped the tears from his eyes, uncovered his face, and, taking his cup, made a drink-offering to the gods; but when the Phaeacians pressed Demodocus to sing further, for they delighted in his lays, then Ulysses again drew his mantle over his head and wept bitterly.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " No one noticed his distress except Alcinous, who was sitting near him, and heard the heavy sighs that he was heaving.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So he at once said, Aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, we have had enough now, both of the feast, and of the minstrelsy that is its due accompaniment; let us proceed therefore to the athletic sports, so that our guest on his return home may be able to tell his friends how much we surpass all other nations as boxers, wrestlers, jumpers, and runners.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " With these words he led the way, and the others followed after.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " A servant hung Demodocuss lyre on its peg for him, led him out of the cloister, and set him on the same way as that along which all the chief men of the Phaeacians were going to see the sports; a crowd of several thousands of people followed them, and there were many excellent competitors for all the prizes.\n\n\n###\n\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Clytoneus came in first by a long way; he left every one else behind him by the length of the furrow that a couple of mules can plough in a fallow field.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " 67 They then turned to the painful art of wrestling, and here Euryalus proved to be the best man.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Amphialus excelled all the others in jumping, while at throwing the disc there was no one who could approach Elatreus.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Alcinouss son Laodamas was the best boxer, and he it was who presently said, when they had all been diverted with the games, Let us ask the stranger whether he excels in any of these sports; he seems very powerfully built; his thighs, calves, hands, and neck are of prodigious strength, nor is he at all old, but he has suffered much lately, and there is nothing like the sea for making havoc with a man, no matter how strong he is.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You are quite right, Laodamas, replied Euryalus, go up to your guest and speak to him about it yourself.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When Laodamas heard this he made his way into the middle of the crowd and said to Ulysses, I hope, Sir, that you will enter yourself for some one or other of our competitions if you are skilled in any of themand you must have gone in for many a one before now.\n\n\n###\n\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Your return home will not be long delayed, for the ship is already drawn into the water, and the crew is found.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Ulysses answered, Laodamas, why do you taunt me in this way? my mind is set rather on cares than contests; I have been through infinite trouble, and am come among you now as a suppliant, praying your king and people to further me on my return home.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Then Euryalus reviled him outright and said, I gather, then, that you are unskilled in any of the many sports that men generally delight in.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I suppose you are one of those grasping traders that go about in ships as captains or merchants, and who think of nothing but of their outward freights and homeward cargoes.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There does not seem to be much of the athlete about you.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " For shame, Sir, answered Ulysses, fiercely, you are an insolent fellowso true is it that the gods do not grace all men alike in speech, person, and understanding.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " One man may be of weak presence, but heaven has adorned this with such a good conversation that he charms every one who sees him; his honeyed moderation carries his hearers with him so that he is leader in all assemblies of his fellows, and wherever he goes he is looked up to.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Another may be as handsome as a god, but his good looks are not crowned with discretion.\n\n\n###\n\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Your ill-judged remarks have made me exceedingly angry, and you are quite mistaken, for I excel in a great many athletic exercises; indeed, so long as I had youth and strength, I was among the first athletes of the age.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, however, I am worn out by labour and sorrow, for I have gone through much both on the field of battle and by the waves of the weary sea; still, in spite of all this I will compete, for your taunts have stung me to the quick.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So he hurried up without even taking his cloak off, and seized a disc, larger, more massive and much heavier than those used by the Phaeacians when disc-throwing among themselves.\n\n\n###\n\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " If anyone wants to have a bout with me let him come on, for I am exceedingly angry; I will box, wrestle, or run, I do not care what it is, with any man of you all except Laodamas, but not with him because I am his guest, and one cannot compete with ones own personal friend.\n\n\n###\n\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Running is the only point in respect of which I am afraid some of the Phaeacians might beat me, for I have been brought down very low at sea; my provisions ran short, and therefore I am still weak.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " They all held their peace except King Alcinous, who began, Sir, we have had much pleasure in hearing all that you have told us, from which I understand that you are willing to show your prowess, as having been displeased with some insolent remarks that have been made to you by one of our athletes, and which could never have been uttered by any one who knows how to talk with propriety.\n\n\n###\n\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Not a man nor maid in the house knew about it, but only himself, his wife, and one housekeeper: when he drank it he mixed twenty parts of water to one of wine, and yet the fragrance from the mixing-bowl was so exquisite that it was impossible to refrain from drinking.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I filled a large skin with this wine, and took a wallet full of provisions with me, for my mind misgave me that I might have to deal with some savage who would be of great strength, and would respect neither right nor law.\n\n\n###\n\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " When he had so done he sat down and milked his ewes and goats, all in due course, and then let each of them have her own young.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " He curdled half the milk and set it aside in wicker strainers, but the other half he poured into bowls that he might drink it for his supper.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When he had got through with all his work, he lit the fire, and then caught sight of us, whereon he said: Strangers, who are you? Where do sail from? Are you traders, or do you sail the sea as rovers, with your hands against every man, and every mans hand against you? We were frightened out of our senses by his loud voice and monstrous form, but I managed to say, We are Achaeans on our way home from Troy, but by the will of Jove, and stress of weather, we have been driven far out of our course.\n\n\n###\n\n"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " The cruel wretch vouchsafed me not one word of answer, but with a sudden clutch he gripped up two of my men at once and dashed them down upon the ground as though they had been puppies.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Their brains were shed upon the ground, and the earth was wet with their blood.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Then he tore them limb from limb and supped upon them.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " He gobbled them up like a lion in the wilderness, flesh, bones, marrow, and entrails, without leaving anything uneaten.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " As for us, we wept and lifted up our hands to heaven on seeing such a horrid sight, for we did not know what else to do; but when the Cyclops had filled his huge paunch, and had washed down his meal of human flesh with a drink of neat milk, he stretched himself full length upon the ground among his sheep, and went to sleep.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I was at first inclined to seize my sword, draw it, and drive it into his vitals, but I reflected that if I did we should all certainly be lost, for we should never be able to shift the stone which the monster had put in front of the door.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So we stayed sobbing and sighing where we were till morning came.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When the child of morning, rosy-fingered dawn, appeared, he again lit his fire, milked his goats and ewes, all quite rightly, and then let each have her own young one; as soon as he had got through with all his work, he clutched up two more of my men, and began eating them for his mornings meal.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Presently, with the utmost ease, he rolled the stone away from the door and drove out his sheep, but he at once put it back againas easily as though he were merely clapping the lid on to a quiver full of arrows.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " As soon as he had done so he shouted, and cried Shoo, shoo, after his sheep to drive them on to the mountain; so I was left to scheme some way of taking my revenge and covering myself with glory.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " In the end I deemed it would be the best plan to do as follows: The Cyclops had a great club which was lying near one of the sheep pens; it was of green olive wood, and he had cut it intending to use it for a staff as soon as it should be dry.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " It was so huge that we could only compare it to the mast of a twenty-oared merchant vessel of large burden, and able to venture out into open sea.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I went up to this club and cut off about six feet of it; I then gave this piece to the men and told them to fine it evenly off at one end, which they proceeded to do, and lastly I brought it to a point myself, charring the end in the fire to make it harder.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When I had done this I hid it under dung, which was lying about all over the cave, and told the men to cast lots which of them should venture along with myself to lift it and bore it into the monsters eye while he was asleep.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The lot fell upon the very four whom I should have chosen, and I myself made five.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " In the evening the wretch came back from shepherding, and drove his flocks into the cavethis time driving them all inside, and not leaving any in the yards; I suppose some fancy must have taken him, or a god must have prompted him to do so.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " As soon as he had put the stone back to its place against the door, he sat down, milked his ewes and his goats all quite rightly, and then let each have her own young one; when he had got through with all this work, he gripped up two more of my men, and made his supper off them.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So I went up to him with an ivy-wood bowl of black wine in my hands: Look here, Cyclops, said I, you have been eating a great deal of mans flesh, so take this and drink some wine, that you may see what kind of liquor we had on board my ship.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I was bringing it to you as a drink-offering, in the hope that you would take compassion upon me and further me on my way home, whereas all you do is to go on ramping and raving most intolerably.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You ought to be ashamed of yourself; how can you expect people to come see you any more if you treat them in this way? He then took the cup and drank.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " He was so delighted with the taste of the wine that he begged me for another bowl full.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Be so kind, he said, as to give me some more, and tell me your name at once.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I want to make you a present that you will be glad to have.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " We have wine even in this country, for our soil grows grapes and the sun ripens them, but this drinks like Nectar and Ambrosia all in one.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I then gave him some more; three times did I fill the bowl for him, and three times did he drain it without thought or heed; then, when I saw that the wine had got into his head, I said to him as plausibly as I could: Cyclops, you ask my name and I will tell it you; give me, therefore, the present you promised me; my name is Noman; this is what my father and mother and my friends have always called me.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But the cruel wretch said, Then I will eat all Nomans comrades before Noman himself, and will keep Noman for the last.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " This is the present that I will make him.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " As he spoke he reeled, and fell sprawling face upwards on the ground.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " His great neck hung heavily backwards and a deep sleep took hold upon him.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Presently he turned sick, and threw up both wine and the gobbets of human flesh on which he had been gorging, for he was very drunk.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Then I thrust the beam of wood far into the embers to heat it, and encouraged my men lest any of them should turn faint-hearted.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When the wood, green though it was, was about to blaze, I drew it out of the fire glowing with heat, and my men gathered round me, for heaven had filled their hearts with courage.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " We drove the sharp end of the beam into the monsters eye, and bearing upon it with all my weight I kept turning it round and round as though I were boring a hole in a ships plank with an auger, which two men with a wheel and strap can keep on turning as long as they choose.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Even thus did we bore the red hot beam into his eye, till the boiling blood bubbled all over it as we worked it round and round, so that the steam from the burning eyeball scalded his eyelids and eyebrows, and the roots of the eye sputtered in the fire.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " As a blacksmith plunges an axe or hatchet into cold water to temper itfor it is this that gives strength to the ironand it makes a great hiss as he does so, even thus did the Cyclops eye hiss round the beam of olive wood, and his hideous yells made the cave ring again.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " We ran away in a fright, but he plucked the beam all besmirched with gore from his eye, and hurled it from him in a frenzy of rage and pain, shouting as he did so to the other Cyclopes who lived on the bleak headlands near him; so they gathered from all quarters round his cave when they heard him crying, and asked what was the matter with him.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What ails you, Polyphemus, said they, that you make such a noise, breaking the stillness of the night, and preventing us from being able to sleep? Surely no man is carrying off your sheep? Surely no man is trying to kill you either by fraud or by force? But Polyphemus shouted to them from inside the cave, Noman is killing me by fraud; no man is killing me by force.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Then, said they, if no man is attacking you, you must be ill; when Jove makes people ill, there is no help for it, and you had better pray to your father Neptune.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Then they went away, and I laughed inwardly at the success of my clever stratagem, but the Cyclops, groaning and in an agony of pain, felt about with his hands till he found the stone and took it from the door; then he sat in the doorway and stretched his hands in front of it to catch anyone going out with the sheep, for he thought I might be foolish enough to attempt this.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " As for myself I kept on puzzling to think how I could best save my own life and those of my companions; I schemed and schemed, as one who knows that his life depends upon it, for the danger was very great.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " In the end I deemed that this plan would be the best; the male sheep were well grown, and carried a heavy black fleece, so I bound them noiselessly in threes together, with some of the withies on which the wicked monster used to sleep.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There was to be a man under the middle sheep, and the two on either side were to cover him, so that there were three sheep to each man.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " As for myself there was a ram finer than any of the others, so I caught hold of him by the back, esconced myself in the thick wool under his belly, and hung on patiently to his fleece, face upwards, keeping a firm hold on it all the time.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Thus, then, did we wait in great fear of mind till morning came, but when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, the male sheep hurried out to feed, while the ewes remained bleating about the pens waiting to be milked, for their udders were full to bursting; but their master in spite of all his pain felt the backs of all the sheep as they stood upright, without being sharp enough to find out that the men were underneath their bellies.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " As the ram was going out, last of all, heavy with its fleece and with the weight of my crafty self, Polyphemus laid hold of it and said: My good ram, what is it that makes you the last to leave my cave this morning? You are not wont to let the ewes go before you, but lead the mob with a run whether to flowery mead or bubbling fountain, and are the first to come home again at night; but now you lag last of all.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is it because you know your master has lost his eye, and are sorry because that wicked Noman and his horrid crew has got him down in his drink and blinded him? But I will have his life yet.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If you could understand and talk, you would tell me where the wretch is hiding, and I would dash his brains upon the ground till they flew all over the cave.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I should thus have some satisfaction for the harm this no-good Noman has done me.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " As he spoke he drove the ram outside, but when we were a little way out from the cave and yards, I first got from under the rams belly, and then freed my comrades; as for the sheep, which were very fat, by constantly heading them in the right direction we managed to drive them down to the ship.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The crew rejoiced greatly at seeing those of us who had escaped death, but wept for the others whom the Cyclops had killed.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " However, I made signs to them by nodding and frowning that they were to hush their crying, and told them to get all the sheep on board at once and put out to sea; so they went aboard, took their places, and smote the grey sea with their oars.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Then, when I had got as far out as my voice would reach, I began to jeer at the Cyclops.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Cyclops, said I, you should have taken better measure of your man before eating up his comrades in your cave.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You wretch, eat up your visitors in your own house? You might have known that your sin would find you out, and now Jove and the other gods have punished you.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " He got more and more furious as he heard me, so he tore the top from off a high mountain, and flung it just in front of my ship so that it was within a little of hitting the end of the rudder.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " 81 The sea quaked as the rock fell into it, and the wash of the wave it raised carried us back towards the mainland, and forced us towards the shore.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But I snatched up a long pole and kept the ship off, making signs to my men by nodding my head, that they must row for their lives, whereon they laid out with a will.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When we had got twice as far as we were before, I was for jeering at the Cyclops again, but the men begged and prayed of me to hold my tongue.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do not, they exclaimed, be mad enough to provoke this savage creature further; he has thrown one rock at us already which drove us back again to the mainland, and we made sure it had been the death of us; if he had then heard any further sound of voices he would have pounded our heads and our ships timbers into a jelly with the rugged rocks he would have heaved at us, for he can throw them a long way.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But I would not listen to them, and shouted out to him in my rage, Cyclops, if any one asks you who it was that put your eye out and spoiled your beauty, say it was the valiant warrior Ulysses, son of Laertes, who lives in Ithaca.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " On this he groaned, and cried out, Alas, alas, then the old prophecy about me is coming true.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There was a prophet here, at one time, a man both brave and of great stature, Telemus son of Eurymus, who was an excellent seer, and did all the prophesying for the Cyclopes till he grew old; he told me that all this would happen to me some day, and said I should lose my sight by the hand of Ulysses.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I have been all along expecting some one of imposing presence and superhuman strength, whereas he turns out to be a little insignificant weakling, who has managed to blind my eye by taking advantage of me in my drink; come here, then, Ulysses, that I may make you presents to show my hospitality, and urge Neptune to help you forward on your journeyfor Neptune and I are father and son.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " He, if he so will, shall heal me, which no one else neither god nor man can do.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Then I said, I wish I could be as sure of killing you outright and sending you down to the house of Hades, as I am that it will take more than Neptune to cure that eye of yours.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " On this he lifted up his hands to the firmament of heaven and prayed, saying, Hear me, great Neptune; if I am indeed your own true begotten son, grant that Ulysses may never reach his home alive; or if he must get back to his friends at last, let him do so late and in sore plight after losing all his men [let him reach his home in another mans ship and find trouble in his house.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " 82 Thus did he pray, and Neptune heard his prayer.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Then he picked up a rock much larger than the first, swung it aloft and hurled it with prodigious force.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " It fell just short of the ship, but was within a little of hitting the end of the rudder.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The sea quaked as the rock fell into it, and the wash of the wave it raised drove us onwards on our way towards the shore of the island.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When at last we got to the island where we had left the rest of our ships, we found our comrades lamenting us, and anxiously awaiting our return.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " We ran our vessel upon the sands and got out of her on to the sea shore; we also landed the Cyclops sheep, and divided them equitably amongst us so that none might have reason to complain.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " As for the ram, my companions agreed that I should have it as an extra share; so I sacrificed it on the sea shore, and burned its thigh bones to Jove, who is the lord of all.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But he heeded not my sacrifice, and only thought how he might destroy both my ships and my comrades.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Thus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun we feasted our fill on meat and drink, but when the sun went down and it came on dark, we camped upon the beach.\n\n\n###\n\n"}
